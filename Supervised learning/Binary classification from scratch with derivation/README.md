# Binary Classification from Scratch with Derivation

Implementation of binary classification algorithm from scratch with mathematical derivations and explanations.

## Overview
- Builds a binary classification model from first principles
- Includes mathematical derivations of the algorithms
- Uses the heart disease dataset for predictions
- Implements logistic regression or neural networks from scratch

## Dataset
- Heart Disease Dataset (heart-disease.csv)
- Features: age, thalach (max heart rate), and other medical indicators
- Target: Binary classification (disease vs. no disease)
- Visualizes relationships between age, heart rate, and disease presence

## Features
- Data exploration and visualization
- Correlation matrix analysis
- Heatmap visualization of feature correlations
- Custom implementation of classification algorithms
- Step-by-step mathematical derivations

## Technologies Used
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

## Key Visualizations
- Scatter plots showing disease patterns by age and heart rate
- Correlation heatmaps
- Decision boundary visualization
