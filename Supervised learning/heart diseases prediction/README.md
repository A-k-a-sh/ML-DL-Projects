# Heart Disease Prediction

Machine learning project to predict the presence of heart disease using various medical indicators and patient data.

## Overview
- Binary classification problem: predict presence of heart disease
- Multiple notebook experiments (1.ipynb through 8.ipynb)
- Includes setup and data preprocessing steps
- Uses various machine learning algorithms for comparison

## Dataset
- Heart Disease Dataset (heart-disease.csv)
- Contains medical features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.
- Target variable indicates presence or absence of heart disease
- Includes both categorical and numerical features

## Project Structure
- `setUp.ipynb`: Initial setup and data loading
- Notebooks 1-8: Different experiments and model implementations
- Systematic approach to model building and evaluation

## Technologies Used
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn (train_test_split and ML algorithms)
- Warnings filtering for clean output

## Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Train-test split (80-20)
3. Feature-target separation
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Comparison of different approaches across notebooks
