# Bulldozer Price Prediction

Regression project to predict the sale price of bulldozers based on various features and sale date information.

## Overview
- Predicts bulldozer auction sale prices
- Uses time-series and categorical features
- Handles date preprocessing and feature engineering
- Deals with missing data and multiple feature types

## Dataset
- Bulldozer auction dataset (TrainAndValid.csv)
- Contains sale dates, equipment specifications, and sale prices
- Includes many categorical and numerical features
- Large dataset with 412,698+ records

## Key Challenges
- Date feature preprocessing (converting sale dates to usable formats)
- Handling missing values across multiple columns
- Feature engineering from temporal data
- Managing categorical variables

## Technologies Used
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn (potentially)

## Data Processing
- Converts sale dates to year/month/day features
- Exploratory data analysis of price distributions
- Visualization of price trends over time
- Feature correlation analysis
