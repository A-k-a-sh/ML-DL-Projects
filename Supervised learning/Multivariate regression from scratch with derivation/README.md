# Multivariate Regression from Scratch with Derivation

Implementation of multivariate (multiple) linear regression from scratch with complete mathematical derivations.

## Overview
- Builds multivariate regression from first principles
- Handles multiple input features (TV, Radio, News advertising)
- Includes mathematical derivations and gradient descent
- Predicts sales units based on multiple advertising channels

## Dataset
- Synthetic advertising dataset with 600 records
- Features:
  - TV advertising spend ($17-$230)
  - Radio advertising spend ($37-$46)
  - News advertising spend ($13-$70)
- Target: Units sold
- Data generated with realistic correlations between features and target

## Key Concepts
- Multiple linear regression (3+ features)
- Matrix operations for regression
- Gradient descent for multiple variables
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Cost function in multiple dimensions

## Technologies Used
- NumPy (for matrix operations)
- Pandas (for data handling)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Companies in Dataset
Includes tech companies: Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Tesla, Microsoft, Uber

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding multivariate regression mathematics
- Implementing vectorized gradient descent
- Handling multiple features simultaneously
- Visualizing high-dimensional relationships
- Feature importance and correlation analysis
