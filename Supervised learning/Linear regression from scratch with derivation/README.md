# Linear Regression from Scratch with Derivation

Implementation of linear regression algorithm from first principles with complete mathematical derivations.

## Overview
- Builds linear regression from scratch (no sklearn for core algorithm)
- Includes mathematical derivations and explanations
- Demonstrates gradient descent optimization
- Uses synthetic advertising data for demonstration

## Dataset
- Custom generated dataset simulating tech company ad spending
- Features: Radio advertising spend (congested in $35-45 range)
- Target: Sales units
- 50 synthetic data points from various tech companies

## Key Concepts
- Simple linear regression (one feature)
- Cost function derivation
- Gradient descent implementation
- Correlation between features and target
- Model evaluation metrics

## Technologies Used
- NumPy (for mathematical operations)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Pandas (for data handling)

## Companies in Dataset
Includes major tech companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, Tesla, and many more.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding the mathematics behind linear regression
- Implementing optimization algorithms from scratch
- Visualizing the relationship between advertising spend and sales
